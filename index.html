            <p>The project within Apple Inc. for developing the iPhone began with a request in 2004 from CEO Steve Jobs
                to the company's hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall and design engineer Sir
                Jonathan Ive to work on the highly confidential "Project Purple.While pitting two teams of engineers led
                by Fadell and Forstall, Jobs decided to investigate the use of touchscreen devices and tablet computers
                (which later came to fruition with the iPad).[4][5][6][7] Jobs ended up pushing for a touch-screen
                device that many have noted has similarities to Apple's previous touch-screen portable device, the
                Newton MessagePad.Like the MessagePad, the iPhone is nearly all screen. Its form factor
                is credited to Apple's Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive.Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and
                traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand
                markets for Apple to enter, despite receiving many requests for Apple to create another PDA. In 2002,
                after the iPod launched, Jobs realized that the overlap of mobile phones and music players would force
                Apple to get into the mobile phone business. After seeing millions of Americans carrying separate
                BlackBerrys, phones, and Apple's iPod MP3 players; he felt eventually consumers would prefer just one
                device.</p>
